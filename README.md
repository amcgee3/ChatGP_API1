# The Researcher

## Inspiration
I realized that during this hackathon I was a bit understaffed and needed a hand doing the research. So I decided that I should create a program that utilizes chatgpt to create the ideal partner. I can tell it what to do and I don't get any back sass whatsoever.
## What it does
It queries the built in databases for the information that I request, and can be fine-tuned based on the requirements that I set for it to give me its output. It is still experimental, but I have created my own version of the bot complete with speech recognition, and it can talk back to us with its queries. 
## How we built it
I used c# to create the user interface, and control the database interactions that allow me to both save past conversations and let my fact checkers see any information that needs to be checked. For a more complete explanation, see me during the final judging. 
## Challenges we ran into
Most of the challenge was getting my API up and running due to a few errors in the documentation. Once that was finished I hit the ground running, and began working like a well oiled machine to complete tasks in my mental workflow.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was my first solo Hackathon, and I'm really proud of myself for getting out of my shell and not being a loner the whole time. I'm really proud of my work, and I would love to see others follow suit in working with chatgp and other similar api to create their own projects. I was able to really test my knowledge of c# and learn a lot of new concepts due to this hackathon. 
## What we learned
I've learned how to interact with the Chatgp API, and learned a lot of the cool features that it has. I've also learned more about the cool libraries that c# has that can use speech recognition and even getting the bot to talk to people instead of just typing text on the screen. 
## What's next for The Researcher
I am working on my master's thesis and other works that I will need to graduate. I am currently thinking of ways to improve this project and use it to teach others as I pursue my career goals of being a software developer, and maybe doing a bit of teaching on the side.
